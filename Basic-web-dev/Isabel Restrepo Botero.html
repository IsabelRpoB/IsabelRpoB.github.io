          <h1>Opening of Unknown Building</h1>
       </head>
             <p> A brand new Building is soon to open in Medellín, Colombia. The building is about 10 floors high and has big windows letting in sunlight. What is so peculiar about this building is that it has not been previously announced they just started building it in a really small lot in a <b> wealthy </b> part of town. The neighbourhood ourhood in which the building is set is full of individuals who work from home. This a problem due the noise made by the buildings construction. The building is situated between two buildings, blocking the view of the people nearby. Which         also make people pretty angry <br/>
                <h2> Building Owners face legal problems </h2>

                    <blockquote> <q> The building is not only obstructing my view and my sunlight, but the construction is making my dog crazy! It is often shaking and leaving its feces all over the floor!</q> <br/> <br/>

  Due to the high number of complaints, the building has been through some legal problems with the Town Hall. But sadly for the complainers, the building's lawyer has managed to stop all of the angry demands, and they <strong> did not </strong> have any legal problem. Anyhow, the building had a few problems of its own. It seems that one of the owners of the building is facing some legal problems. The law is investigating the case, and meanwhile, the building construction is getting paused for a few weeks until we know more about his criminal activities. <br/><br/>

While the name of the owner stays unknown, some affirm that he was a drug dealer some years ago. We don't have much information about the topic, but his partner in crime affirms that they sold together near <em> El Tesoro </em>, a big shopping mall in the city. The police have interviewed the suspect's family and friends, looking for results, but all of them claim that they know nothing and there is probably some kind of mistake. We are waiting for more information. <br/>
