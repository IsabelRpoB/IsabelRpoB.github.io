   <p> Lately, an article has been released informing the sudden construction of an unnamed building in a wealthy part of town. The reporters claim that no citizen knows this building's use or name. All we know is that the building neighbors ain't happy with the construction working hours or the location of the building. But, fortunately for them, the construction is taking a break for a short time due to some possible criminal activity used to pay for the building construction. </br> </br>
